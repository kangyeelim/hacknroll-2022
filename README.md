## Inspiration
We were too excited about the hackathon that we only slept one hour... With a lack of brain juice and a strong desire to sleep, we decided to create an app that will help us do just that!

## What it does
This webpage will help people with difficulties falling asleep following the ancient method of counting sheep, with a twist!

## How we built it
With love and lack of sleep. Also, a touch of ReactJS was used.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is the first cow that has ever jumped over the spinning moon.

## What's next for The cow jumps over the moon
More animals will be coming soon to jump over astronomical objects! Get ready to be BORED out of your mind and fall right into a deep slumber!
